         <Text style={styles.detail} >4: Clean keyboard</Text>
         <Text style={styles.detailsmal} >As tempting as it might be to drink coffee, soda, water or any other liquid near your laptop, accidents can happen all too easily. Alternatively, use a cup with a cover on it, so even if it does spill, the liquid doesn't go anywhere. Spilled liquids may damage the internal microelectronic components or cause electrical damage. Short circuits can corrupt data or even permanently destroy some parts of the laptop. The solution is very simple: Keep your drinks away from your computer. Even if you are careful, someone else might spill your drink. Also, don't eat over your laptop, the crumbs can fall between the keys and provide an invitation to small bugs or damage the circuitry. </Text>
